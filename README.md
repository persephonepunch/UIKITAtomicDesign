Why UIKIT
Even if you are using a vanilla framework. UIKIT lets you wrap vertical and horizontal nested uk-grid and uk-flex

It is a GREAT resolve for wrapping legacy Bootstrap 3 Templates that do not Flex Vertical Heights.

Also use if you have naming collision for Legacy Angular Name / Scoped UI conflicts
